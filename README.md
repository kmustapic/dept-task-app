# Dept Bootcamp App

A React application that allows users to register/login, fetch random countries from an API, save favorite countries for later, and view country details including capital, population, area, dialing codes, currencies, and map.

## Features

* **User Authentication**: Register and login via JWT (/registration, /login).

* **Fetch Random Countries**: Request 1â€“10 random countries from the Bootcamp API.
